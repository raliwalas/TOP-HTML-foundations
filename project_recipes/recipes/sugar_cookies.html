        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <p>Christmas Sugar Cookies: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 3/4 cups (230 grams) all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (113 grams) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (150 grams) granulated white sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Royal Icing</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg white</li>
            <li>1 teaspoons fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (165 grams) confectioners (powdered or icing) sugar, sifted</li>
        </ul>


        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>For Sugar Cookies:  In a separate bowl whisk together the flour, salt, 
                and baking powder. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of your electric mixer (or with a hand mixer), beat the butter 
                and sugar until light and fluffy (about 3 to 4 minutes). Add the eggs and 
                vanilla extract and beat until combined. Add the flour mixture and beat 
                until you have a smooth dough.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough in half and wrap each half in plastic wrap. Refrigerate 
                for about one hour or until firm enough to roll.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (177 degrees C) and place rack in center of 
                oven. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Remove one half of the chilled dough from the refrigerator and, on a lightly 
                floured surface, roll out the dough to a thickness of 1/4 inch (1 cm). (Keep 
                turning the dough as you roll, making sure the dough does not stick to the 
                counter.) Cut out cookies using a lightly floured tree cookie cutter and 
                transfer cookies to the prepared baking sheet. Place the baking sheets with 
                the unbaked cookies in the refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes to chill the 
                dough which prevents the cookies from spreading and losing their shape while baking.</li>
            <li>Bake cookies for about 10 minutes (depending on size) or until they begin 
                to brown around the edges. Remove from oven and let cookies cool on baking 
                sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to finish cooling. 
                Frost with royal icing, if desired. Be sure to let the royal icing dry completely 
                before storing. (This may take several hours.)
            </li>
            <li>Frosted cookies will keep several days in an airtight container. Store between 
                layers of parchment paper or wax paper. Makes about 20 4-inch (10 cm) cookies
            </li>
            <li>For Royal Icing:  In the bowl of your electric mixer (or with a hand mixer), 
                beat the egg whites with the lemon juice. Add the sifted powdered sugar and 
                beat on low speed until combined and smooth. The icing needs to be used immediately 
                or transferred to an airtight container as royal icing hardens when exposed to air. 
                Cover with plastic wrap when not in use.</li>
        </ol>
